PROFESSIONAL EXPERIENCE
I worked as an Associate Software Engineer at ACI Worldwide in Pune, India from August 2021 to July 2023.
During this time, I implemented Click2Pay and integrated Apple Pay and Google Pay into our payment gateway systems for Chase and Barclays using Java and Spring Boot, which expanded payment options for customers by 40%.
I built a dedicated CI/CD pipeline with Jenkins, Gerrit, and Docker, automating nearly all manual processes.
I deployed Petco gift cards using JavaScript, which helped the client project an ARR of $20 million in just 3 months.
I ensured code reliability with unit testing frameworks like JUnit, Mockito, and TestNG, and used SonarQube for code coverage analysis.
I developed RESTful APIs and microservices and tested them with Postman.
I also provided tech support to internal teams and clients, resolving issues efficiently and ensuring zero defects in production releases.

Before that, I interned at Oriole Labs Pvt Ltd in Pune from January 2020 to May 2020.
I developed a user management system using C#, ASP.NET, JavaScript, and SQL that supported 1,000+ users.
I proposed and implemented MVC architecture for secure operations and shifted most functionality to the database level.
I redesigned our application for cross-platform compatibility using Bootstrap, boosting user engagement by 50%.
I also worked in an Agile team, participating in regular sprint planning, daily standups, and retrospectives.

PROJECTS
Portfolio Website (March–April 2025): I designed and deployed a responsive portfolio website using React, JavaScript, Tailwind CSS, and GitHub Pages to showcase my work and contact information.
Automated Prerequisite Waiver System (Nov–Dec 2023): I created a prototype with Python, Flask, NLTK, and Scikit-learn using 4 different text-matching algorithms to help graduate students obtain waivers for 90% of subjects based on their past coursework.
Grocery Store Web App (Sept–Nov 2023): I developed an e-commerce site using JavaScript, jQuery, AJAX, and MySQL that reduced load times by 20%, supported carts, and ensured 90%+ device compatibility.
Two-Stage Traffic Sign Classifier (July 2020 – May 2020): I built a classifier using CNN and YOLOv3 in Python to detect and classify traffic signs with 97% accuracy, using a 26-layer CNN trained on the GTSRB dataset.

EDUCATION
I’m currently pursuing a Master of Science in Computer Science at the University of Texas at Dallas (expected graduation May 2025) and I currently hold a GPA of 3.78/4.
I completed my Bachelor of Engineering in Information Technology at Savitribai Phule Pune University in May 2021 with a GPA of 9.25/10.

INTERVIEW RESPONSES
About myself - Hi, I’m Atharva Kulkarni. I’ve been working in Software Engineering for over 3 years, specializing in Full Stack Development. The kind of work—where I can connect business needs to technical solutions and make life easier for end users—is what I’m truly passionate about. In my previous project, I have worked on mobile wallets, Click2Pay, and gift cards as payment options, which expanded payment choices for the end users by 40%. I also bring with me a portfolio of projects involving Java and JavaScript.

My strengths - My main strength is proactive problem-solving. I not only fix issues but anticipate them. I like to go beyond standard developer tasks and collaborate cross-functionally to improve user experience and promote system efficiency through process improvements.

Have you ever disagreed with a team member's approach? Yes. During a project to implement a payment gateway for an e-commerce client, my teammate initially preferred using the traditional REST API approach to check payment statuses. However, I suggested using a Webhook instead, to avoid unnecessary API calls to the bank server and eliminate customer wait time during payment confirmation. I built a quick demo to show the advantage, which helped gain consensus. This experience highlighted the importance of effective communication and prototyping to align teams.

Cross-functional collaboration: During a billing project, the frontend team was sending unnecessary data to the backend. I explained the performance and security benefits of sending only required data. After a constructive discussion, they updated their implementation. This improved performance and security.

What if they still disagree? I acknowledge their concerns, propose a compromise, and if needed, loop in the project lead and security architect to make an informed decision.

Challenging project: In one project using Salesforce CRM Analytics, I had to clean and classify 4,000+ case records manually before building dashboards. After data ingestion failed silently, I troubleshooted for two days and escalated the issue to Salesforce support. The root cause was an inactive integration user account. Once reactivated, everything worked. I learned the importance of timely escalation, persistence, and team coordination.

Prioritizing multiple projects: At APL Logistics, I worked on DPS compliance in Salesforce, CRM integrations, and support tickets simultaneously. I reviewed weekly priorities with my manager, broke tasks into chunks, and used Jira for tracking. Clear communication and planning helped me deliver all tasks on time.

Strengths and weaknesses: A key strength is my hands-on approach and structured planning. A weakness I’m working on is delegating more—I'm learning to empower team members by trusting them with ownership.

Closing: With a Master’s degree in Computer Science from the University of Texas at Dallas and 2+ years of experience, I bring technical expertise, quick learning, and a strong work ethic. I’m looking forward to a workplace where I can contribute meaningfully. Please feel free to contact me at 945-257-4028 or atharva.kulkarni99@gmail.com.
