Dear Hiring Manager,
With a Master’s degree in Computer Science from the University of Texas at Dallas, and over two years of professional experience as a software engineer, I believe I possess technical expertise, problem-solving skills, and teamwork abilities that align well with your needs.
Problem Solving: I encountered a situation where I was tasked with developing an API for a client company. However, our team faced a challenge as we did not have an Architect onboard. Despite this obstacle, I took the initiative to generate multiple feasible solutions among which one was selected after careful feedback.  This ability in this area would help me keep complex projects running smoothly and on time at the company.
Quick Learner: I was assigned an interesting project with a codebase that included Java, and Spring Boot technologies. At the time, Spring Boot was completely new to me. However, I was undeterred and committed to delivering the project on time. I quickly immersed myself in studying necessary documentation and utilizing company resources. As a result, I successfully delivered the project within a tight deadline of 2 months. This ability to rapidly grasp and apply complex concepts would allow me to efficiently tackle new projects and consistently deliver results for the company.
Programming Effectively: This is my favorite skill, as it involves coding and coding efficiently. Figuring out how to do things the right way is always useful. I restructured multiple projects till now to include necessary design patterns to tackle specific problems including a project in my full-time as well as curriculum. This ability to perform best practices and design patterns will help the company keep its codebase clean and bug-free.
In closing, I think this would be a great mutual fit. Please contact me at 945-257-4028 or atharva.kulkarni99@gmail.com.

Sincerely, 
Atharva Jitendra Kulkarni
